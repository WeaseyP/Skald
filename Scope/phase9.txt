Phase 9 (NEW): UI/UX & Parameter Overhaul


Goal: Evolve the user interface from merely functional to truly intuitive and professional by implementing context-aware controls and expanding the parameter set for deep, expressive sound design.

Task 1: Advanced Parameter Implementation: Integrate the full suite of proposed parameters into both the frontend state and the backend Odin codegen.

ADSR Node: Add Amount/Depth, Velocity Sensitivity, and Curve controls.

Oscillator Node: Add Pulse Width for Square waves and Phase control.

Effect Nodes (Delay, Reverb, etc.): Ensure universal Wet/Dry Mix controls.

LFO/Delay Nodes: Add BPM Sync toggles.

Polyphonic Wrapper: Add Voice Count, Voice Stealing, Glide, and Unison/Detune parameters.

Task 2: Context-Aware UI Controls: Replace generic sliders with controls appropriate for each parameter's function.

Implement Logarithmic Sliders for all frequency (Hz) parameters.

Implement Exponential Sliders for all envelope time (ms) parameters.

Create a BPM-Synced Dropdown/Stepper control that replaces the time/rate slider when sync is enabled.

Design and implement a Graphical ADSR Envelope Editor to replace the four individual sliders for the ADSR node.

Implement an X/Y Pad Control for the Filter node, mapping cutoff frequency to the X-axis and resonance to the Y-axis.

Task 3: Core Interaction Polish: Improve the micro-interactions that define the core user workflow.

Implement Shift + Drag modifier on all sliders and knobs for fine-grained control.

Implement a Double-Click or Ctrl + Click shortcut on all controls to reset them to their default value.

Implement smart text input parsing for frequency fields (e.g., "2k" -> 2000).
